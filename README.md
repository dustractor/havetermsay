# havetermsay
[Vim-plugin] gives a command :Havetermsay which provides a substitute for approximately 0.001% of tmux functionality.

Tmux is not currently available for Windows.  Only Linux and Mac OS users have tmux.  Among many other use cases for tmux, one which is particularly useful to a programmer is:

    tell a terminal to run a command

No, not just "a" terminal.  The same one over and over.  Be able to give it a label or some way to refer to it consistently.  Some way to ask it "are you there, terminal?"

Either it is there or it is not, in which case, make it be there, so we can have it say something.

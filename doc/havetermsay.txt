                                                      *HavetermsayUsage*

usage example:

HaveTermSay <server-name> <what-to-say>

server name is what to call the server

<what-to-say> must of course be escaped as per a vim command and since we're dealing with windows paths it will probably suck but here is an example that *works for me*:

First, I have a function in the vimrc:

fun! Blender()
    let l:b = escape(expand("$BLENDER")," \\")
    exe "Havetermsay foo \"".l:b."\""
endfun

Then there is an autocommand that assigns a mapping to call that function:

Note: I edit my environment variables to have $BLENDER point to the
executable.

aug Bpying
    au!
    au BufNew,BufReadPost ~/bpy/*.py nmap <silent><buffer><F12> :silent! call Blender()<CR>
aug END


What the above snippet from my vimrc does is if I'm editing a file inside the bpy folder (where i keep scripts for blender) then it assigns f12 in normal mode to a command that runs blender in a vim terminal.
